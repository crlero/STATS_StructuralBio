"""
Welcome to Statools!\n
A sample Structural Biology-Python project installable for the Calculation\
of Protein structure Statistical Potentials.\n

You can use this tool for quality assessment of a protein structure.\n
There are two different modules belonging to statools: functions and plot.\n
Both contain functions that are mainly used for the executable script 'stats',\n 
though they are either way imported to python library packages.\n 
Thus, functions can be imported to the interpreter and use them independently.\n
See each function description for a further detail.\n
Thank you!\n
Jorge Roel and Cristina Leal
